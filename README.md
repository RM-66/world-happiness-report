# CSE412 Final Project Template (Idyll)

## Team Members

Tianyu Pan, Hongying Wu, Ruimin Zhang, Robert Zheng

### Contribution Statements

Tianyu Pan creates the line plots for six factors, and writes the most paragraphs in the Report;

Hongying Wu creates the interactive world map, and edits the github pages;

Ruimin Zhang uses a machine learning model to predict the potential happiness score of different countries for 2022, and creates a heatmap by comparing the influence of six factors;

Robert Zheng calculates monotonic score for all countries, and filters out monotonic incresing countries.

## Project Proposal Abstract

We are hoping to find out what makes people happy and the happiness level among different groups of people as people pay more attention to their happiness and quality of life. Therefore, in our project, we use the [World Happiness Report](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/world-happiness-report-2019) datasets to research the happiness level across countries and time. We use the _‘score’_ index to observe how different factors are linearly related to _‘score’_. In this proposal, we selectively choose data from 2019 as a reference to explore.


### Developing

Our project post can be found at [https://cse412-21sp.github.io/world-happiness-report/](https://cse412-21sp.github.io/world-happiness-report/).

The webpage is created with Idyll, which is a markup language for creating beautiful interactive webpages. Graphic tools including matplotlib and seaborn from Python environment and Tableau are used in our project.

### Machine Learning Code and Result

- The Python code for Machine Learning is stored in main with name  `prediction_code.ipynb`
- The output of predicted ranks for year 2022 is stored in main with name `history_rank_and_predictions.csv`
