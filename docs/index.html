Why should we care about happiness scores in this fast-paced world? What might be some key indicator of happiness? What makes us happy as an individual? How does Covid-19 affect the happiness score?</p><p>Indeed, these questions are difficult to answer. Happiness is a subjective measure and can be hard to categorize. But undoubtedly, these questions serve as the baseline for other areas such as mental health and national growth, and are crucial to everyone’s daily life. First, we want to understand why happiness is important and why we should care about it. According to the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2011 titled “Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development”, the resolution states that “the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal”; moreover, happiness is “a universal goal and aspiration embodies the spirit of Millennium Development Goal″. Many studies indicate that happiness not only relates to how we feel, but also “links to better decision-making and improved creativity”. Scientists point out that happiness could be the key to success.</p><p>After learning the importance of happiness, now let’s delve into our project. In this project, we aim to find out how the happiness score varies across different countries over years and how the happiness score is affected by some important factors such as GDP per capita and healthy life expectancy. We used the World Happiness Report datasets to research the happiness level across countries and time. We used the ‘score’ index to observe how different factors are linearly related to the ‘score’.</p><br/><h2 id="score-distribution">Score Distribution</h2><hr/><select options="2015,2016,2017,2018,2019,2020,2021"><option selected="" value="2015">2015</option><option value="2016">2016</option><option value="2017">2017</option><option value="2018">2018</option><option value="2019">2019</option><option value="2020">2020</option><option value="2021">2021</option></select><div><img src="static/images/score_distribution/2015.jpg" idyll="[object Object]"/></div><hr/><p>As we can see from the graphs above, one thing that we noticed is that less and less people tend to give the happiness score <strong>above <!-- -->7</strong>.</p><p>Most people rated their happiness around 4.5-6.5 and it’s consistent over the years, indicating most people were satisfied with their current lives, but at the same time there might be some factors preventing them from giving the higher happiness scores.

Above are interactive plots that describe the happiness score in each country
from 2015 to 2021.</p><p>In this interactive plot, we use a color scale to differentiate the happiness
score rated from 1 to 10. Even though most scores are between 2 to 8, we try to
include some very extreme scores to avoid the ignorance of any country’s
records. Based on the graph, we can see the countries in Africa have more
changes than other continents, and countries like China have barely changed.
However, take Russia as an example, even though the overall score did not change
 so much, the overall rank of Russia decreased through these years, from 64 in2015 to 76 in 2021. Therefore, we can conclude that it is not always a monotonic
 increase of the happiness score in all countries.</p><h3 id="interactive-world-map">Interactive World Map</h3><p>Below is an interactive plot that describes the happiness score in each country

One country that attracts our attention is Togo, Africa. Togo has a significant increaseing in the happiness score. In 2015, it ranked the last among 158 countries, and had a score of 2.839; in 2016, the rank moved up</p></div></div></div></div>
